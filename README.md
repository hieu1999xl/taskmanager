 You can list tasks by time periods that include **monthly**, **weekly**, **daily** and **all**.
 
 You can also show **past** or **completed** tasks.
 
 The color of tasks that on past is more lighter than that on current or future.
 
 The completed task is understood by isCompleted column.
 
 If you want to **edit** or **detail** or **delete** any task, you can do it by buttons at the end of the row.
 
 *The form is dynamically posted by selecting radiobuttons.*
